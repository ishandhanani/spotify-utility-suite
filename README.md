# Spotify Utility Suite

Welcome to the Spotify Utility Suite (SUS). This is a personal project that I've create to experiment with Spotify and interact with my music in a novel way. This project started as a simple data mining exercise and developed into a web application consisting of the following 

1. A program that can be used to visualize statistics of certain songs or playlists 
2. A clustering algorithm that can compare personal "artist" playlists and Spotify's "This is <Artist>" playlists. More on this later 

Find the web app at bit.ly/susuite

Additionally, there is an automation program that allows you to sort liked songs into various artist playlists. That can be found in `auto_arrange.py`

Feel free to create PR's if you'd like to see any features or want to contribute!

Features I'll be working on next

1. Recommendation system that uses the data from (1)
2. Multiprocessing (2) to decrease runtime for large collections of playlists
3. Finishing the TODO items on auto_arrange.py

Enjoy!
