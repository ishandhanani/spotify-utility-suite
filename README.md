# Spotify Utility Suite

Welcome to the Spotify Utility Suite (SUS). This is a personal project that I've create to experiment with Spotify and interact with my music in a novel way. This project started as a simple data mining exercise and developed into a web application consisting of the following 

1. A program that can be used to visualize statistics of certain songs or playlists 
2. A clustering algorithm that can compare personal "artist" playlists and Spotify's "This is <Artist>" playlists. More on this later 
3. (In-progress) A recommendation system tuned on the statistics I described in (1)

Feel free to create PR's if you'd like to see any features or want to contribute!

Enjoy!
