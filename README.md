# Deep dive into the artists I listen to

This repository consists of 3 parts
1. A data processing script that can be used to pull tracks from an playlist along with numeric features and a popularity score
2. A notebook where I explore differences between my personal artist playlists and compare them to Spotify's artist playlists 
3. (In-progress) A recommendation system tuned on a selection of lyrical and lofi-beat rap (a genre I enjoy)

Enjoy!
